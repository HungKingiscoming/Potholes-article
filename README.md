# A comparison of semantics segmentation approaches for pothole detection.
### Potholes Problems Overview
A pothole is a depression or cavity in the road surface that gradually develops as a result of water infiltration, repeated traffic load, and adverse weather conditions, leading to deterioration of the pavement. Potholes pose a significant threat to road safety, as they can damage vehicles, compromise driving comfort, and increase the risk of accidents by causing abrupt maneuvers or endangering cyclists and pedestrians.

So we provides a thorough comparison of various semantic segmentation techniques applied to pothole detection on road surfaces. The models evaluated encompass traditional CNN-based architectures, including U-Net, FPN, and DeepLabv3, as well as advanced Transformer-based approaches such as SegFormer, Swin-Unet, and Mask2Former.
